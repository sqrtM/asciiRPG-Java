# asciiRPG-Java
cute side project based on the first couple pages of trystan's old asciipanel tuto. trying to go at it as blindly and naively as possible so I can learn what not to do in the future.

looking to build this out a lot as more of an interactive ant farm for now, rather than a full RPG. currently working on getting something of an ecosystem simulation up and running.
